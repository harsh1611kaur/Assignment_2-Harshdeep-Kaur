          Mahatma Gandhi, byname of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, (born October 2,
          1869, Porbandar, India—died January 30, 1948, Delhi), Indian lawyer,
          politician, social activist, and writer who became the leader of the
          nationalist movement against the British rule of India. As such, he
          came to be considered the father of his country. Gandhi is
          internationally esteemed for his doctrine of nonviolent protest
          (satyagraha) to achieve political and social progress.

          Gandhi was the youngest child of his father’s fourth wife. His
          father—Karamchand Gandhi, who was the dewan (chief minister) of
          Porbandar, the capital of a small principality in western India (in
          what is now Gujarat state) under British suzerainty—did not have much
          in the way of a formal education. He was, however, an able
          administrator who knew how to steer his way between the capricious
          princes, their long-suffering subjects, and the headstrong British
          political officers in power.
